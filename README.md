# Hello World!

I'm  **Helena Martins**. I'm a Brazilian Front-end developer. I currently live in Fortaleza and I've been working remotely for [Magna Sistemas](https://www.magnasistemas.com.br/wps/portal/internet) as Front-end developer JR.
 
I've been studying Front-end since 2020 and I've taken part in the developing group of [Victoria Chamber of Commerce and Industry](https://www.victorianchamber.com.au), and worked as Front-end developer and Project manager at [Global Parking Solutions](https://www.globalparkingsolutions.com) and [Tote Bar and Dining](https://www.totebaranddining.com.au) when working for [Outroll](https://www.outroll.com).

I am a former English teacher. I hold a degree in English and Portuguese language and literature, a master degree in Ancient literature and a Cambridge Advanced English certificate.
In my free time, I enjoy watching films, reading graphic novels, drinking beer with good friends, making amigurumis and playing video games.
