# Hello World!

I'm  **Helena Martins**. I'm a Brazilian Front-end developer. I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo and work remotely for [Outroll](https://outroll.com) as Front-end developer JR and Project Manager JR.
 
I've been studying Front-end since 2020 and I've taken part in the developing group of [Label Hq](https://www.labelhq.com.au), and worked as Front-end developer and Project manager at [Global Parking Solutions](https://www.globalparkingsolutions.com).

I am a former English teacher. I hold a degree in English and Portuguese language and literature, a master degree in Ancient literature and a Cambridge Advanced English certificate.
In my free time, I enjoy watching films, reading graphic novels, drinking beer with good friends, making amigurumis and playing video games.
